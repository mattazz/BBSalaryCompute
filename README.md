- Improved on the import function not needed the '15th or 30th' input from the user anymore and just reads the date
- Added comments to the code for readability 

09-01-2022
- Added a 5th selection for importing wage data from excel file

Main2.0
- Updated salary and benefits computation to match real-world process (Pag-Ibig is deducted 1st half, SSS and PH is deducted 2nd half)
- Included output for half-month payroll
- Included salary computation (menu 4) for employees without benefits (part-time and contractual)

Notes: 
- Salary benefit deductions are computed based on a per day basis. For the half-month payroll, deductions are made depending on which half of the month is selected. 
- Output for half-month payroll is saved in the 'Output' folder
